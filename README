Start by openning the physical layer.
    this can be done by running the command ./physical.exe [enter a port]

EX) ./physical.exe 39000

to continue, in another terminal you need to open the data link layer. 
to do this you will need to run the following command ./datalink.exe [IP of the host] [host PORT] [exit PORT]

EX.) ./datalink.exe lab13.cs.ndsu.nodak.edu 39000 39001

to continue, in another terminal you will need to open the network layer.
to do this you will need to run the following command ./Network.exe [IP of datalink] [Port of datalink] [Name]

EX.) ./Network.exe lab13.cs.ndsu.nodak.edu 39001 John

you will then need to repeat opening the data link layer and the network layer for the second half of the connection. 
once established, both network layers should be able to talk to eachother. you can terminate each connection by typing "EXIT" or by pressing Ctlr+C
